Check-list reminder: When a new DSC is created you ( or your team) should remember to:  

1) Welcome them by sending them the Volunteer guidelines https://diem25.org/volunteer-guidelines/  and Social Media Guidelines https://diem25.org/social-media-rules/ in the respective languages if available

2) Register them on the  internal database ( adding the email addresses of both coordinators ( ideally in gender balance),  as well as facebook and twitter pages and official public email) – DSC will only appear on the webite “ map” and registry after doing thos.

3) Create them and official email address within your domain ( ex: Palau1DSC@uk.diem25.org) via post fix here: https://diem25-001.diem25.net/postfixadmin/login.php

Tell them about the onboarding procedure: DSC coordinator shall send the names and email addreses of their members to cloud@diem25.org with the title “Cloud onboarding DSC XYZ”  so that the admins receive the email and can work on it. Ask to be in cc to those emails just in case something needs follow up.

8) DSC News about formation of the New DSC - Ask the members of the DSC to send 2/3 short paragraphs about their first meeting + a photo so we can upload it an article on DSC News in english. Once you have the text send it to Davide Castro Davide.castro@hotmail.com and  my email in copy (Giannamerki@gmail.com)

8) Zoom welcome call - Last but not least: Schedule a quick a zoom call with them, even if 15m , to onboard, answer questions  and give basic support, advice and tips
